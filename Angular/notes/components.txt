  yes, you can create a component manually or by a command " ng generate component component-name"

  what component contains?
  component contains .html(template),.css(styling), .ts(component/model),.spec.ts(testing),
  every component should inform to modules.

  If one component inside another component then outer one is called parent component, inner one is called child component

  2. child to parent
    @viewChild:
    @Output():
