Directives are the commands to manipulate the behaviour of DOM.
There are three types of Directives in Angular
1. property/attribute Directives:
These directives are used to manipulate properties of a element in the DOM
[ngClass]="{'classname':flagname,'classname2':flagname2}",
 you can add as many as classes you like
[ngStyle] ="{'stylename':'value','stylename':flagname?value:value2}"
 you can add as many as styles you like

2. structural Directives: 
we can change the structure of our template by DOM using these directives
 1.ngIf: 






3. custom directives
